# Maingron Steam Theme


## About Maingron Steam Theme
This is a theme I once created for my Steam client. It's nothing special. Originally I only swapped a few color variables for darker ones.


## Installing
You can install the Steam Theme by copying the `maingron` folder located in `theme/skins/` into the Steam skins folder. In my case the path is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\skins\`. When you extract the download, the folder structure should look / contain something like this:
```txt
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\skins\
        └───maingron
            └───resource
                ├───images
                │       steam_home.png
                │       steam_home_os.png
                │       steam_home_vr.png
                │       steam_logo.tga
                │
                └───styles
                        steam.styles

Note: There might be additional files and folders.
```
