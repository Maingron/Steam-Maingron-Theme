# Maingron Steam Theme

Note: This Repo is archived since there's a new Steam client version, that I suppose isn't compatible with this theme anymore, and I'm not interested in continuing this project. Feel free to fork this repo, if necessary!

## About Maingron Steam Theme
This is a theme I once created for my Steam client. It's nothing special. Originally I only swapped a few color variables for darker ones.


## Installing
You can install the Steam Theme by copying the `maingron` folder located in `theme/skins/` into the Steam skins folder. In my case the path is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\skins\`. If a `skins`-folder doesn't exist, you can just create it. When you extract the download, the folder structure should look / contain something like this:
```txt
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\skins\
        └───maingron
            └───resource
                ├───images
                │       steam_home.png
                │       steam_home_os.png
                │       steam_home_vr.png
                │       steam_logo.tga
                │
                └───styles
                        steam.styles

Note: There might be additional files and folders.
```
